This folder contains the code used to create the geodemographic classifications tested in the paper.

- The `NAGAE` folder contains the code necessary to define and train our main approach, the Node Attributes-focused Graph AutoEncoder (NAGAE).
- The `GNN-CorrNet` folder contains the code necessary to define and train a series of approaches based on graph neural networks (GCN and GraphSAGE) combined with common representations (CorrNet).
- The `baselines` folder contains the code necessary to define and train a series of baseline approaches based on k-means and spatial fuzzy c-mean (SFCM).
