    "**Step 1: Spatial Graph Construction**: For demonstration purpose, we presented one of the experiments mentioned in our paper which constrasts the spatial graph using the *K*-nearest neighbours (KNN) method (using *Pysal* to identify geospatial neighbourhoods for each OA and construct a spatial graph. The number of *K* in KNN is defined as 8, based on the average number of direct neighbours among OAs in the study area. It is important to note that that is one of many possible approaches. Different ways of constructing spatial graphs may have positive or negative impacts on the output of spatially explicit deep learning models, and therefore introducing additional uncertainties into the geographical analysis."
